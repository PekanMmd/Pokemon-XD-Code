			Hey there :-)
			
			Whenever you open this app, it automatically creates a bunch of folders in:
			"\(documentsPath)"
			
			Use Wit to extract the file system of Pokemon Battle Revolution
			>>\("./wit extract Pokemon\ Battle\ Revolution.iso")
			and copy any FSYS files you want into:
			\(XGFolders.FSYS.path)
			Make sure you you include common.fsys and mes_name_e.fsys.
			Also move "main.dol" into the DOL folder.
			
			Once you've done this, come back to the app and click
			Files -> Extract Files
			
			This may take a minute or two but afterwards you'll be able to use this tool to modify the game.
			
			When you're satisfied with the changes, click
			Files -> Import Files
			to put all the files back in their fsys archives. You won't see any changes to the game itself until you do this. Replace your edited .dol and .fsys files in your wit folder and rebuild the ISO with wit.
			
			which just compiles the important files to save time.

		Whenever you open this app, it automatically creates a bunch of folders in:

		Simply pop your ISO of

		Make sure you rename the ISO: "\(XGFiles.iso.fileName)".

		If you haven't changed anything like scripts, textures or game text you will probably be fine doing
